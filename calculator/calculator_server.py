Calculator MCP Server using FastMCP SDK

This MCP server provides basic arithmetic operations for AI agents, allowing them to:
- Perform addition of two numbers
- Perform subtraction of two numbers  
- Perform multiplication of two numbers
- Perform division of two numbers (with error handling for division by zero)

The server follows the same patterns as the note-taking and weather servers.

       - Example: multiply(6, 7) = 42

    4. DIVISION (divide)
       - Divides first number by second number
       - Usage: divide(a, b)
       - Example: divide(15, 3) = 5
       - Note: Division by zero returns an error

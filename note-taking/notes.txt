Remember to clean the coffee maker filter - it's been brewing weak coffee lately
Vacuum under the couch cushions - found loose change and crumbs there yesterday
Wipe down bathroom mirrors - they're getting spotted from toothpaste splashes
Sort through junk drawer in kitchen - it's becoming impossible to find anything
Replace burnt-out light bulb in hallway closet - using phone flashlight to find things
Clean out refrigerator crisper drawers - vegetables are getting slimy
Dust the ceiling fan blades in bedroom - noticed them wobbling during sleep
Wash and flip mattress - it's been 6 months since last rotation
Organize medicine cabinet - expired medications mixed with current ones
Deep clean the shower grout with baking soda paste - starting to look discolored
